# 

# \## Academic Integrity

# 

# This repository is intended for \*\*Reichman University Computer Science students\*\*.

# 

# \* Do \*\*not\*\* submit solutions directly as your own coursework.

# \* Use this as a \*\*learning aid\*\*: attempt problems yourself first, then consult reference solutions.

# \* Solutions may be locked until official deadlines pass.

# 

# > Our aim is to make this a flagship repo for Reichman University â€” a model of clarity, accessibility, and integrity.
